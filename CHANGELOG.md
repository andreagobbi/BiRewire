#from V 2.3.3 to V.2.3.4
*fixed wrong labeling when graph are used instead of incidence/adjacence matrix
*starting to work with DSG graph instead of using incidence matrix (should works)
* still having some problems with get.edgelist function of igraph, sometimes the id of the vertex are not consecutive (and so there are some problem in C), too time-consuming to check (expecially for sampler)
